## Project plan

### Project description

From the summer of 2015, Blackwood began to rollout a new technology-enabled care platform called ‘CleverCogs’ within the organisation’s care homes and care at home locations. Giving our participating customers a touchscreen home hub, CleverCogs empowers our care customers by having assistance at hand, enabled by video communication with our staff who respond through a new smartphone app as well as the ability to receive diarised reminders and prompts. Through our other apps designed in-house, CleverCogs is far more than a simple care device with our customers discovering new avenues through internet access to rekindle old interests, research hobbies and play favourite music, games or movies. Finally, our customers can connect using a ‘Family and Friends’ video calling app where they can interact face to face with people miles away and contact carers more easily. 

## Project milestones

Stage One:

In June 2015, a Digital Skills Trainer was appointed and a new learning and development programme created to assist with new digital ways of working in our Stirling care home. Further training sessions were developed and 1:1 workshops organised to help our staff with the transition toward this new and smarter way of working. 
Training began week commencing 6th July 2015 with our residents on using the CleverCogs system and marked the beginning of our journey toward building digital skills across Blackwood. As all of our residents had never used technology before, training was delivered in one-to-one visits by the Digital Skills Trainer to build confidence and familiarity with the new system. After a 3-month period, our residents began to quickly engage well with the system and a follow-up in August 2015 found that 75% of our residents using the system felt their digital skills had improved. Feelings of boredom were at 21% in our baseline conducted in April 2015 which reduced to 8% in the same follow-up. 

Stage Two:

In September 2015, we started our rollout across our care at home services in Tayside. We initially started with the system being introduced in 12 of our customers’ homes. We introduced CleverCogs in Tayside Services as a new digital rota system where we could have more real time updates on care-related appointments and visits. The Family & Friends app proved to be a big success especially given that a lot of our customers using CleverCogs within a care at home setting live alone and this proved powerful in increasing face-to-face communication, combating depression and loneliness. Lessons learnt from our Stirling care home were taken into consideration and implemented into newly updated learning and development packages. 

Stage Three:

As we entered 2016, we increased our CleverCogs customers in Tayside from 12 to over 40, expanding our presence in quarters 1 & 2 to include Angus (in Arbroath, Carnoustie and Montrose) and in dispersed locations across Perthshire. We employed a new Digital Skills Intern who will be based in Tayside Services to further support the rollout and learning of the system whilst the project expands in our other services. 
On our 1st Anniversary, we brought our learning together from the early rollout at Stirling and held new learning group days at our care home to gather all our residents and staff together to learn new aspects of the system. We successfully introduced multiplayer games that enable residents to interact amongst each other or with family & friends. After successfully piloting our new rota system in Tayside Services, we upskilled our residents in being able to self-plan and use the Calendar app to better communicate with Family & Friends. We were delighted that one of our championing residents was awarded a Scottish Care Award at a ceremony in Glasgow for her participation in using the system and recognising her efforts in teaching other residents and staff on how to operate CleverCogs. The customer uses the system to call her sister every evening and has enabled clearer communication as well as our customer being able to see other family members she had difficulty seeing physically in the past. In addition, we saw another customer enrol in a computing course in order to further develop the skills that were both acquired and inspired by using CleverCogs.
On 16th May 2016, we went live with a new service based in Edinburgh in partnership with Edinburgh City Council to use CleverCogs as a new responder service, utilising the system’s video-calling feature. We are using the system to help people with learning disabilities after using the system to support our care customers with physical disabilities. One of the customers participating in this new service commented that “CleverCogs has given me control of my support back” and we are currently arranging for another customer to be able to use the Family & Friends app to have video calls with her sister in America!  
We recently deployed our first Android version of CleverCogs for one of our customers with visual impairment and started training him on new accessibility features that are opening up a new digital world for the customer. In addition, we are currently in the early stages of developing a new e-Learning platform which we plan to rollout across the organisation in the coming months to continue building digital skills in newly designed staff induction sessions.

## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project:
•	Delivered digital skills training to over 150 staff and 70 customers;
•	Held group-based learning with 32 residents in our Stirling care home;
•	Deployed over 220 tablet devices and smartphones to enable delivery of the project.

In terms of outputs we delivered training on communicating through the new video-calling feature on carer smartphones and Family & Friends on customer devices in Stirling, Dundee and Edinburgh. By introducing internet resources, we have built our customers digital skills up from a novice level, teaching on the managing of information by having access to GP surgery websites, local transport, driving tests and hobby and interest pages by the team uploading digital content in preparation of training visits. All 150 staff have additionally been upskilled in problem solving by being trained and developed on how to troubleshoot technical-related issues on customer devices and through their smartphones.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has reduced social isolation. We know this because of higher interaction in communal areas in the care home compared to when the system went live. Reduced depression for our customers by no longer having to rely on family members to assist with accessing digital resources and plans for online shopping tutorials will prevent reliance on carers having to include this in support time. A reduction in boredom by holding group-based learning days and connecting staff with customers that has allowed more quality time with residents, showing new digital features and them seeing how what they are doing is helping to develop our customers’ digital skills.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

•	Having a dedicated resource to assist with the training, support and development of the project;
•	Having a team approach to the project – our Telecare Implementation Co-ordinator installing brackets and offering a cross-section of devices to enable accessibility;
•	Introducing stylus touchscreen pens which proved to be a “game changer” in allowing our residents and customers to physically use the device;
•	Starting in our care home in Stirling which was a safe-test site due to the service being staffed 24/7;
•	Having both individual and group-based learning in training sessions to accommodate learning styles and preferences;
•	How we approached our customer training – building trust and good relationships to enable confidence with digital technology;
•	Identifying what people’s likes and interests are in advance of training sessions through a needs assessment so we were able to tailor and personalise digital content for them prior to installation.
•	The introduction of an Android version of CleverCogs has enabled us to use tablets with some customers. The accessibility features built into Android has enabled a new level of accessibility as well as significantly reducing deployment costs.

Things that we would do differently next time:
•	Having more of a pace with staff learning and development, more resources needed to support the transition;
•	Organising more group-based learning with our customers and allocating more time to that kind of learning over individual;
•	Conducting more training needs analysis to better tailor training sessions to our staff’s digital backgrounds.
